## INTRO

I proudly presents Dungeon Crawler - the first level of my text rpg game fully made in OOP.
I have been working on this project for some time now. The idea at the beginning was to make a simple game in which you fight monsters and loot items.
As I continued to write code more ideas came and the game become more of a tile base rpg with different features that I thought at that time I couldn't implement.
But eventualy I made everything work (or I hope so) and here it is - the first level of Dungeon Crawler.


## HOW TO PLAY

At the beginning, after you choose your name, you start at a random location on the map. Then starts the moving phase in which you move across the map by typing directon commands (left, right...).
In rooms you can encounter various objects such as treasures, shrines and mostly monsters.
As you encounter a monster the pre-fight phase starts in which you can switch equiped gear and prepare to fight in any way you want. Once the fight starts you
can only use potions.
To fight a monster you can use basic attack that generates action points that you can spend on special abilities which you aquire after equiping certain type of weapon.
After the fight (in case you don't die), the loot will drop and the moving phase starts again.
The goal of the is defeating the boss of the level.
