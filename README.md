Here is the first level of my text rpg game fully made in OOP.

The point of the game is to defeat the main boss of the level which consists of small rooms each containing an object or a monster.

As in other rpg games you can find various items which you can equip to increase character stats and fight enemies more easily.

You move your character between room by typing directon commands (left, right...) and in battles you are able to do several actions such as view you char, (un)eqip gear, view map etc.

In the future I might add eg. exp system, special abilities and maybe even some game graphics - we'll see how it goes. 

EDIT: I impleted some new features and the current build isn't yet tested.
