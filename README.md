Here it is - my masterpiece - the first level of my text rpg game fully made in OOP.

The point of the game is to defeat the main boss of the randomly generated level which consists of small rooms many of which consists of objects and monsters.
As in other rpg games you can find various items which you can equip to increase character stats and fight enemies more easily. You level up as you progress and are able to choose from perks to boost your hero.
You move your character between room by typing directon commands (left, right...) and in battles you are able to do several actions such as use special abilties depending on equiped weapon, view you chararacter, (un)eqip gear, view map etc.


NOTES:
- player abilities currently doesn't work due to the implementation of decorators
